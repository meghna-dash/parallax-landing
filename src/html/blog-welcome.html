              We’re introducing Parallax, a platform that lets you help your users better navigate your product. When new users get onto your application, they often need help to get started and be successful. People want your product to solve a problem for them, and if it takes too long to see that goal, you’re likely to see high rates of churn, known as desired outcome churn.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-9">
              The ideal situation is that you’re able to look over their shoulder and point them in the right direction, but this can get increasingly difficult at higher scale. It can take some time to onboard new users, and the people with the expertise to do this often don’t have time to sit down for every customer concern.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-9">
              You might provide in-depth guides and videos, but the likelihood is that a large chunk of users will never do more than glance at documentation. People don’t really like to leave the platform they’re on to learn how to complete a task, and their attention spans drop off after a couple minutes of reading or watching a video. A combination of these two can be deadly for your churn rate.
            </p>

                Teams struggle to make their onboarding experience as good as their core product, so the results are poor satisfaction and retention.

              We aim to provide a solution that lets you provide much-needed help for your users without overwhelming them with heavy, confusing onboarding flows and product tours. We believe that brief, stepped video guides with a specific purpose can do wonders in helping your users achieve early goals, especially when these guides are available in-application. The easier this process is for both you and your users, the better you'll be able to help them, and the more they'll be satisfied with your product.
